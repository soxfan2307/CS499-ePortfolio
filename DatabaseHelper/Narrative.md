## ðŸ“Œ Artifact Narrative 3: Android App with Database Integration (Databases / Software Engineering)

### Description
This artifact represents the completed Android application with full database integration. Originally, the database logic was simple and exposed to potential vulnerabilities. Through the enhancement process, I improved `DatabaseHelper.java` and expanded changes across multiple files â€” `MainActivity.java`, `LoginActivity.java`, `DataDisplayActivity.java`, `AddWeightActivity.java`, and `DataAdapter.java`. These changes transformed the app into a secure, fully functional weight-tracking application.

### Justification for Inclusion
I included this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to design and integrate a **secure, scalable database solution** into a mobile application.  
- Showcases skills in **SQL schema design**, **parameterized queries**, and **error handling**.  
- Demonstrates ability to coordinate changes across multiple components of a system.  
- Represents my strongest work in combining **databases with full application development**.  

### Reflection on Enhancement Process
The biggest lesson from this enhancement was the importance of **database security and maintainability**.  
- **Challenges:** ensuring consistent database functionality across all activities.  
- **Feedback:** led me to add the `DataAdapter` class to improve maintainability and simplify data presentation.  
- **Learning:** iterative testing across activities reinforced how integration requires careful planning and verification.  

**Course Outcomes Met:** Databases (fully), Software Design & Engineering (fully).
