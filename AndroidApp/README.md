# Android Weight Tracking App

## Overview
This Android application allows users to securely log in and track their weight over time. The app stores weight entries in a local database and displays them in a simple table format with corresponding dates. It was designed to balance usability, functionality, and security.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Software Design & Engineering**: Refactored activities to improve readability, modularity, and maintainability.  
- **Database Integration**: Used SQLite for reliable storage of weight entries.  
- **Security**: Applied input validation and structured queries to improve safety.  
- **User Experience**: Simplified app flow between login, input, and data display for a smoother user experience.  

## First Enhancement (Capstone)
The **first enhancement** focused on refactoring and improving three main files:  

- **`MainActivity.java`** – Restructured code to separate concerns and reduce redundancy, making the logic easier to maintain.  
- **`LoginActivity.java`** – Strengthened input validation for login credentials and improved error handling to prevent crashes and invalid user entries.  
- **`DataDisplayActivity.java`** – Refactored code to cleanly display weight and date entries in a user-friendly tabular format.  

Key improvements included:  
- Breaking down large methods into smaller, reusable components.  
- Enhancing input validation across login and data entry.  
- Improving navigation flow and error feedback for end users.  
- Establishing a more modular structure that aligns with **software engineering best practices**.  

This enhancement demonstrated my ability to **refactor existing code for maintainability and security**, while improving the overall user experience.
