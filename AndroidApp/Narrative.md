# Artifact Narrative: Android Weight Tracking App (Enhancement 1)

## Description
The artifact enhanced here was `MainActivity.java`, created as part of a mobile app project for user authentication and weight tracking. Originally, the app lacked coherence and session management capabilities, making user navigation inconsistent. Enhancements also touched `LoginActivity.java` and `DataDisplayActivity.java`.

## Justification for Inclusion
I chose this artifact because it demonstrates my skills in **Android development**, including activity navigation, UI design, and backend database integration.  
Enhancements showcased:  
- Corrected navigation logic between activities.  
- Introduced **SharedPreferences** to keep users logged in across sessions.  
- Added a custom input dialog for weight and date in `DataDisplayActivity`.  
- Saved entries via SQLite using `DatabaseHelper.java`.  

These improvements highlight modular programming, maintainability, and user-focused design.

## Reflection on Enhancement
This enhancement taught me about **session management** in Android apps and the importance of clean activity transitions.  
- **Challenges:** fixing repeated login behavior and validating input.  
- **Feedback applied:** ensured smoother navigation and input handling.  
- **Learning:** shared preferences are an effective, lightweight tool for persisting user state.  

**Course Outcomes Met:** Software Design & Engineering (fully), Database preparation (partially).
