## ðŸ“Œ Artifact Narrative 1: Android Weight Tracking App (Software Design & Engineering)

### Description
The Android Weight Tracking App was originally created as a mobile project that allowed users to input their weight and store it locally. Initially, the app contained minimal validation and had a somewhat rigid design. During the first enhancement, I refactored `MainActivity.java`, `LoginActivity.java`, and `DataDisplayActivity.java` to improve maintainability, user experience, and security.

### Justification for Inclusion
I selected this artifact because it highlights my skills in **software design and engineering**, specifically in refactoring, modular coding, and applying best practices in mobile application development.  
- Showcases ability to refactor large, fragile code into maintainable components.  
- Demonstrates improved input validation and smoother navigation between activities.  
- Reflects professional-level coding practices expected in industry.  

### Reflection on Enhancement Process
Through this enhancement, I learned how critical **clean architecture** and **maintainable code** are in long-term projects.  
- **Challenges:** restructuring activity flow while preserving functionality.  
- **Feedback:** pushed me to strengthen input validation and user feedback.  
- **Learning:** modularity improves readability, usability, and testing.  

**Course Outcomes Met:** Software Design & Engineering (fully), Communication with stakeholders (partially).
