# C++ Buffer Overflow Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the risks of buffer overflow in C++ programs and the importance of secure coding practices. The original version contained vulnerabilities that allowed user input to overwrite memory. Enhancements focused on addressing these risks through safer coding practices.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Managed memory and user input securely.
- **Security Practices**: Identified and mitigated buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- **C++ Programming**: Applied modern best practices for secure input handling.

## Enhancements
- Replaced unsafe character arrays with safer structures such as `std::string`.
- Implemented bounds checking to prevent memory corruption.
- Added user-friendly input validation and error messages.
- Improved code readability and maintainability.

## Location
- Main file: [`MyBufferOverflowApp.cpp`](MyBufferOverflowApp.cpp)
