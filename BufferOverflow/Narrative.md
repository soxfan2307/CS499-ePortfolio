## ðŸ“Œ Artifact Narrative 2: C++ Buffer Overflow Project (Algorithms & Data Structures / Security)

### Description
The C++ Buffer Overflow Project was created to illustrate the risks of buffer overflows in unmanaged memory environments. The original version used unsafe character arrays that allowed input to overwrite memory. For the enhancement, I improved the artifact by replacing unsafe operations with modern, safe practices such as using `std::string`, implementing input validation, and adding bounds checking.

### Justification for Inclusion
I included this artifact because it showcases my **understanding of algorithms, data structures, and security concepts**.  
- Highlights ability to balance **performance with security**.  
- Demonstrates **secure C++ programming** with modern best practices.  
- Explicitly showcases mitigation of real-world vulnerabilities.  

### Reflection on Enhancement Process
Enhancing this artifact taught me how critical **memory safety** is in lower-level programming.  
- **Challenges:** redesigning input handling while preserving behavior.  
- **Feedback:** pushed me to emphasize security risks and add inline documentation.  
- **Learning:** replacing unsafe arrays with modern structures improved safety and maintainability.  

**Course Outcomes Met:** Algorithms & Data Structures (fully), Security (fully).
